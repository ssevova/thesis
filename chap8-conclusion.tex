A search for an excess of events with large \ptmiss produced in association with a top quark pair decaying to the dilepton final state has been presented, using proton-proton collisions. The integrated luminosity of the data sample used corresponds to $35.9\:\textrm{fb}^{-1}$, and was collected by the CMS detector at $\sqrt{s}=13\:\TeV$ at the LHC during 2016. Observations are consistent with no significant deviation from the SM background expectation in the \ptmiss spectrum, in same and opposite lepton flavor channels. Results are interpreted in terms of simplified dark matter (DM) models with scalar and pseudoscalar mediators. Assuming coupling values of $g_{\textrm{q}} = g_{\chi} = 1$ and DM mass $m_{\chi} = 1\:\GeV$, the observed (expected) $95\%$ $\textrm{CL}_{s}$ exclusions for a scalar mediator are $m_{\phi} < 74\:(99)\:\GeV$, and the expected exclusion for a pseudoscalar mediator is $m_{a} < 50\:\GeV$, while no pseudoscalar mediator exclusion is observed. This result improves upon the previous search for DM production in association with a top quark pair~\cite{Sirunyan:2017xgm} performed using a data sample with integrated luminosity of $2.2\:\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected by the CMS detector at $\sqrt{s}=13\:\TeV$ at the LHC during 2015. The previous search fell short of observing and expecting to observe an exclusion at $95\%$ $\textrm{CL}_{s}$ for simplified DM models with scalar and pseudoscalar mediators.
