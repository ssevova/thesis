The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, although an extremely successful theory encoding the properties of elementary particles and their interactions, has its deficiencies. For one, cosmological and astrophysical observations supply compelling evidence~\cite{Bertone:2004pz, Feng:2010gw, Porter:2011nv} for the existence of dark matter (DM), a piece of the astro-particle physics puzzle which does not fit in with the SM.
